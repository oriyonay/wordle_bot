# wordle_bot
A simple AI for the game 'wordle'

Usage: just run the Python script! For every guess, provide the AI with feedback as follows: 'x' for bullseye, 'o' if the letter appears in the word but not in the correct place, and '-' if the letter does not appear in the word at all. For example, if the AI's guess was 'smart' and the word ended up being 'storm', the feedback would be 'xo-xo'.
